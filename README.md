## Introduction

This is template repo for Akvelon coding practice  course.

The purpose is to simplify tracking of your preparation progress.

Please, follow it's recommendation.

For any other ideas ping vitaly.sukhov@akvelon.com.

## Directory and file structure

There are a few directories in the `problems` dir:
- `codewars`    - for tasks from https://www.codewars.com
- `hackerrank`  - for tasks from https://www.hackerrank.com
- `leetcode`    - for tasks from https://leetcode.com/
- `own`         - for own algorithms/problems what are not attached to any change solving service.

Please, create a file for each solved problem in the specific directory.
As an example could be: [longest_substring.go](problems/leetcode/longest_substring.go).

The file should contains:
1. Link to the service (if it is not own task);
2. Problem text / Example of input and output;
3. Approach / Solution how to solve this problem 
4. Cost of algorithm in Big-O notation.

## Process flow

### Preparation

1. Clone this repo;
2. Add your user names for `codewars`, `hackerrank`, `leetcode` to `Progress tracking` section (update `README.md`)


### Problem solving

1. Pick task from the list, read related articles;
2. Solve task (tests on the service should pass);
3. Add solution file to this repo (please, follow recommendation from `Directory and file structure` section)
4. Update a row for the task - add solution file name;
5. Don't fill `approved`

## Progress tracking
