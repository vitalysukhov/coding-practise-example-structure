## Introduction

This is template repo for Akvelon coding practice  course.

The purpose is to simplify tracking of your preparation progress.

Please, follow it's recommendation.

For any other question or ideas ping vitaly.sukhov@akvelon.com.

## Directory and file structure

There are a few directories in the `problems` dir:
- `codewars`    - for tasks from https://www.codewars.com
- `hackerrank`  - for tasks from https://www.hackerrank.com
- `leetcode`    - for tasks from https://leetcode.com/
- `own`         - for own algorithms/problems what are not attached to any change solving service.

Please, create a file for each solved problem in the specific directory.
As an example could be: [longest_substring.go](problems/leetcode/longest_substring.go).

The file should contains:
1. Link to the service (if it is not own task);
2. Problem text / Example of input and output;
3. Approach / Solution how to solve this problem 
4. Cost of algorithm in Big-O notation.

## Process flow

### Preparation

1. Fork this repo on Github;
2. Add your user names for `codewars`, `hackerrank`, `leetcode` to `Progress tracking` section (update `README.md`)


### Problem solving

1. Pick task from the list, read related articles;
2. Solve task (**tests on the service should pass**);
3. Add solution file to this repo (please, follow recommendation from `Directory and file structure` section);
4. Add solution file name to the `Progress tracking` section (replace `TODO` for the specific task). This is the **main indicator of your progress**;
4. Don't fill `approved`, you need to ask someone to review your solutions and maybe even check on the services.
